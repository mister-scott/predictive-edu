Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to dance. She would dance to the music that played on the radio, or the music that played in her head. She would dance in the kitchen, in the living room, in the backyard. She would dance in the rain, in the snow, in the sunshine. She would dance with her friends, with her family, with her pets. She would dance to the music of her heart.

One day, the little girl met a boy who loved to dance, too. He would dance to the music that played on the radio, or the music that played in his head. He would dance in the kitchen, in the living room, in the backyard. He would dance in the rain, in the snow, in the sunshine. He would dance with his friends, with his family, with his pets. He would dance to the music of his heart.

The little girl and the boy fell in love with each other, and they danced together every day. They danced to the music of their hearts, and they danced to the music of each other’s hearts. They danced to the music of their love for each other, and they danced to the music of their love for the world.

The little girl and the boy got married, and they danced together every day of their lives. They danced to the music of their hearts, and they danced to the music of each other’s hearts. They danced to the music of their love for each other, and they danced to the music of their love for the world.

The little girl and the boy had children, and they danced with their children every day. They danced to the music of their hearts, and they danced to the music of each other’s hearts. They danced to the music of their love for each other, and they danced to the music of their love for the world.

The little girl and the boy grew old together, and they danced together every day of their lives. They danced to the music of their hearts, and they danced to the music of each other’s hearts. They danced to the music of their love for each other, and they danced to the music of their love for the world.

The little girl and the boy died together, and they danced together in the afterlife. They danced to the music of their hearts, and they danced to the music of each other’s hearts. They danced to the music of their love for each other, and they danced to the music of their love for the world.
